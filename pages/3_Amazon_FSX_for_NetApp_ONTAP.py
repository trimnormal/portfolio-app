**What is AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP?**

AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully managed service that provides advanced data management 
capabilities, combining the power of NetAppâ€™s ONTAP file system with the scalability, agility, and 
security of AWS. This service allows you to launch, run, and scale fully managed NetApp ONTAP file 
systems in the cloud with ease, providing seamless integration 
with your existing data and applications.

Key features include:

- **High Performance:** Delivers high throughput and low latency 
for both file and block storage workloads.
- **Data Management:** Offers NetApp ONTAP's rich data management features, such as data 
deduplication, compression, tiering, cloning, and snapshots.
- **Scalability:** Scales up to petabytes of data, supporting high-performance 
and I/O-intensive workloads.
- **Security and Compliance:** Provides robust security with encryption at rest and in transit, 
and integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Helps optimize costs with storage efficiency features and the ability to 
choose between SSD and HDD storage options.

AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP is ideal for applications that require shared file storage with 
enterprise-grade features, such as file services, databases, big data analytics, 
and development and test environments.

**Why did I develop this module?**

When I began working on this module in August of 2023 there was no publicly available terraform
module to deploy FSx ONTAP. The FSx family of AWS services is often overlooked in favor of  
AWS EFS to support filesystem workloads. Recognizing a gap in the infrastructure as code community,
 I decided to develop this module to simplify and automate the deployment of FSx for NetApp ONTAP, 
 enabling other cloud engineers to leverage this powerful service without the manual setup.

This module is designed for scale, it provides the ability to deploy as many storage virtual 
machines and volumes as needed. There is only a small layer of abstraction, allowing maximum 
customization, while simplifying the configuration needed for deployment.
